The faculty I interacted with in the Ecology program were also incredibly supportive and helpful, creating a great intellectual community.  The Ecology students are fantastic as well.  Overall, it's a great program and I have very few complaints.  The EvAnth Department was also a good intellectual community, and I received a lot of support from several faculty in both departments, as well as from the administrative staff of both EvAnth and Ecology.

If I had the experience to do over again I would have chosen Larry as my initial advisor. I was working with Bryan Gilliam for a short time before another of his advisees failed her defense and my own prelim was cancelled days before it was set to take place. I changed advisors after Bryan left me repeated messages and phone calls in the middle of the night and told me not to speak to anyone on the faculty or I wouldn't be able to continue the program. To the department's credit (and the Grad School and our ombudsman) this situation was handled with grace and care. Jane and Phil Rupprecht (who was DGS at the time) made sure Bryan wasn't allowed to contact me and took care of paperwork to have my committee changed. However, I firmly believe Bryan should not have been allowed to continue as faculty and an advisor after that point. His work is stellar, but he is incredibly unpredictable as a person, and his interactions with his advisees border on abuse. ,\n",

I also loved that my department was full of friendly students who seemed genuinely happy, and that there was ample opportunity for creating your own experience of graduate school--through both social and professional interactions. I also had the opportunity to co-create and co-teach a course with one of my committee members on professional development--because I received so little training on the subject from my advisor, I learned a ton about it myself and we began a course to spread that knowledge to other students in our department. Duke Biology is a great environment for motivated, self-starting students, and I loved my experience overall.,\n",

The faculty as a whole at DSS are incredibly knowledgeable and deserve their reputation for advancing the frontier of Bayesian statistics as the scope of what is researched there is uncanny given the relatively small size of the department. My advisor and the faculty as a whole are generally aware of the progress all doctoral students have made on their research and are always willing to give advice on what research paths could lead to which professional placements after defending. It seems there are multiple emails a day regarding industry, faculty, and post-doc positions. The DSS alumni are also actively engaged in recruiting from the pool of new graduates for high profile industry jobs such as Google, IBM, Microsoft, etc.. The department faculty is approachable and always helpful, and very fast to respond to emails and requests for help.  ,\n",

I also firmly believe that the training at Duke Marketing and Fuqua generally is rigorous, intellectually challenging, and yet incredibly supportive. All of the faculty took the time to meet with me and help me prepare. In fact, I would also say that I think Duke Marketing is the best at preparing individuals for the academic job market. I've had the chance to speak with other students, even at other top institutions and it is amazing to see what a gap there is between Duke and everyone else. The folks at Duke put in as much time in you as you are willing to invest in yourself. I sincerely feel lucky to be graduating from here. ,\n",
